# 🎬 Movie Rating Database Management System

A Movie Rating Database Management System developed in **C** as part of the **CSE114 – Programming and Problem Solving** course. This first C project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts to solve a real-world problem through structured, procedural programming.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed to demonstrate how the **C programming language** can be used to solve a real-world problem using structured and logical approaches. The system provides a menu-driven command-line interface to manage movie information and ratings efficiently.

The main focus of this project is on **problem analysis, logical thinking, and procedural programming**, which are the core learning objectives of an introductory programming course.
